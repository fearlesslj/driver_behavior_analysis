# Driver behavior analysis
This code repository holds the jupyter notebooks for estimating driver safety on Pointer's dataset. 
It contains a sample of the dataset as well as Python (pandas) and PySpark implementations of the process.

It's best first to go over the python notebook as it contains more details, and then to the pyspark notebook to see the same implementation on pyspark.

### Notebooks:
- Python: https://github.com/omri374/driver_behavior_analysis/blob/master/Driver%20safety%20estimation%20-%20pandas.ipynb

- PySpark: https://github.com/omri374/driver_behavior_analysis/blob/master/Driver%20safety%20estimation%20-%20pyspark.ipynb

### Requirements
- For the python notebook:
  - Python > 3.5
  - **packages**: numpy, scipy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

- For PySpark:
  - Python > 3.5
  - **packages**: numpy, scipy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, pyspark

A code story presenting the entire flow will be uploaded to https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog
